The Corner Cafe has been a local famous cafe for decades. It was first opened by 2 people,
Zena and Poppy, who met during school. They met eachother and became good friends shared  
cups of coffee they made for eachother and decided to create a cozy haven for others to do
the same. Over the years, the cafe has seen countless different restraunts used for the  
cafe as they got more money to buy a bigger building, anniversary celebrations, and 
tearful goodbyes. Customers swear that the heart-shaped latte art is infused with a 
touch of magic, bringing luck to those who sip from it. Now run by their daughters 
and sons, Maria and Paul, the cafe continues to serve love in every cup.</div>
