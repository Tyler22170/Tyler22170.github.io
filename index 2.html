<div class="fourthbox2">Recently I have been making a website its probably not going to be published but itâ€™s just a thing ive been doing to see what its like to make a website of something I made it as a coffee shop called the corner cafÃ© with some made up backstory. In my everyday life I love technology I play xbox a lot and use a lot of electronic devices, I have always been good with technology ive just got the skill of being good at it. In my spare time I play my xbox, I mostly play fortnite, assassins creed valhala or GTA V.  My favorite music artist is mainly Juice Wrld but i like some other songs by other people, music for me is a way of being able to relax and escape from reality and it helps me focus better sometimes because i dont get distracted by anything thats happening around me.  im also a really quick learner once i start to learn something i catch onto how it works quite quickly, during an open day at dover college i learnt how to take a computer apart and put it back together so i took that skill with me and i then fixed a broken xbox one s and now i use it alot.</div>

<div class="fifthbox2"><p>This is the website I made I made this using an app called vscode doing this I learnt how to code and make a working website I came across some issues and some struggles but I managed to do it and im happy with it I have even added a accessibility feature to change the colour to the original colours I had</p>

    <div class="fifthbox2"><p><h3  style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Recently in college i had learnt about active directory and how its secure and what it does.</h3></p>
        <p><h4 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">I will explain what active directory is and how its secure with a word document i made about it, i will add the questions and my answer.</h4></p>
        <p style="color: rgb(128, 2, 2);">What is Active Directory and what does it do?</p>
        <p>It is used to manage and organise information about network resources, such as users, computers, printers, and other devices.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(128, 2, 2);">Why is centralised management a more secure option?</p>
        <p>this is because if you are in control you can keep people who are not under your domain are in there you can remove them and you can make sure people using the servers have restrictions so they do not go on websites or games they are not meant to go on or meant to download.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(128, 2, 2);">What did you do in terms of the configuration?</p>
        <p>We had to create a windows server on a virtual machine that had the admin permissions and set up all the ips then we made a user on the windows 10 virtual machine without permissions using the admin account and we had to add certain ips to the user then set it to a domain so we could set the restrictions.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(128, 2, 2);">Here are the numbered steps of how i did this</p>
        <p>1.	Install windows server and windows 10 virtual machines</p>
        <p>2.	Startup the windows server vm</p>
        <p>3.	Set up windows server and create an admin account </p>
        <p>4.	Set ips and make sure everything is correct</p>
        <p>5.	Open windows 10 vm* and create a user account</p>
        <p>6.	Add ips to the user account </p>
        <p>7.	Set the admin restrictions on windows server vm</p>
        <p>8.	Set up the domain so the admin can change restrictions on windows server vm</p>
        <p>9.	Test the permissions on windows 10 vm the user </p>
        <p>10.	If this was all done correctly you would need the admin password to do things for example download certain things</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(128, 2, 2);">What issues, if any, did you face?</p>
        <p>I had the issue of the ips not working properly then my pc kept crashing each time I opened the server other than that it ran smoothly</p>
